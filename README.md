# EDHREC to Archidekt Python script

Convert any EDHREC deck JSON into a **clean card list for importing into Archidekt (or really any other deck-building platform you want).

---

## What It Does

* Fetches an EDHREC deck JSON directly from its URL.
* Extracts only card names from the JSON.
* Outputs a .txt file with one card name per line (Archidekt-ready).
* Works entirely on Google Colab (no local setup needed).
